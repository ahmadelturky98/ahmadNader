After downloading the 'testAutomation' file, please enter the terminal directory of the 'testAutomation' file and type "npx nightwatch" to witness some magic!!!

***And if an error related to the chromedriver appears, please delete 'chromedrive' file from this directory {ahmadNader-master/testAutomation/node_modules/chromedriver} and run "npm install chromedriver --save-dev" in the terminal, then repeat the initial step.***
